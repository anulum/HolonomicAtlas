The theory modifies this by proposing that the consciousness field's effect on fractal geometry is the more fundamental cause."}]},

                {"question":"The consciousness field Ψ is described as having a global U(1) phase symmetry. What is the most important physical consequence of this property?","hint":"This type of symmetry is common in physics (like in electromagnetism) and it always constrains how fields can interact with observables.","answerOptions":[{"text":"It forces the consciousness field to be massless.","isCorrect":false,"rationale":"The theory explicitly uses the Klein-Gordon equation for a massive scalar field, indicating that U(1) symmetry does not forbid the field from having mass."},{"text":"The absolute phase is unobservable, so interactions must depend on its magnitude squared, |Ψ|².","isCorrect":true,"rationale":"This is the core principle of U(1) symmetry: physical laws must be independent of a global phase shift, which mathematically requires that couplings involve the field and its complex conjugate."},{"text":"It allows the consciousness field to travel faster than light.","isCorrect":false,"rationale":"The field is described by the Klein-Gordon equation, which is Lorentz-covariant and does not permit faster-than-light propagation of information."},{"text":"It ensures that the consciousness field only interacts with gravity.","isCorrect":false,"rationale":"The U(1) symmetry dictates the *form* of interactions, not their scope. The theory proposes couplings to both the phase field and gravity."}]},
                {"question":"What is the relationship between the fractal dimension of spacetime (Df) and gravity in this theory?","hint":"Think of gravity not as a force, but as the consequence of a geometric property of space changing from one point to another.","answerOptions":[{"text":"Gravity causes the fractal dimension to increase over time.","isCorrect":false,"rationale":"The theory proposes the opposite causal direction: changes in the fractal dimension are the cause of what we perceive as gravity."},{"text":"A gradient in the fractal dimension (∇Df ≠ 0) generates spacetime curvature, which we interpret as gravity.","isCorrect":true,"rationale":"This is the core concept of emergent gravity in the theory; a non-uniform fractal dimension creates the geometric distortions we call gravity."},{"text":"The fractal dimension is constant everywhere and has no relationship to gravity.","isCorrect":false,"rationale":"The theory's central premise is that the fractal dimension is dynamic and is fundamentally linked to the phenomenon of gravity."},{"text":"Gravity is an effect that tries to restore the fractal dimension to its baseline value.","isCorrect":false,"rationale":"Gravity is described as the effect of the dimensional gradient itself, not a separate restorative force."}]},
                {"question":"What does the theory identify as the physical manifestation of 'dark matter'?","hint":"Instead of a new particle, the theory suggests that dark matter is a structural feature of spacetime itself, created by one of the fundamental fields.","answerOptions":[{"text":"A new, weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP).","isCorrect":false,"rationale":"This is a leading hypothesis in standard cosmology, but the God of the Math theory proposes a solution that does not involve new fundamental particles."},{"text":"Regions of spacetime with high phase coherence, which generate extra curvature.","isCorrect":true,"rationale":"This explanation fits the observational constraints: these regions would have gravitational influence (extra curvature) but would not interact with light, mimicking dark matter's properties."},{"text":"The gravitational effect of primordial black holes from a previous cosmic cycle.","isCorrect":false,"rationale":"While the theory includes cyclic cosmology, it attributes the dark matter effect to a property of the fields within the current cycle, not to remnants of past epochs."},{"text":"An illusion caused by a modification to the law of gravity on galactic scales.","isCorrect":false,"rationale":"The theory does modify gravity, but it also identifies a specific field structure as the source of the dark matter effect, rather than just changing the force law."}]},
                {"question":"What is the theory's proposed explanation for the flat rotation curves of galaxies, typically attributed to dark matter?","hint":"How does the theory modify the geometry of spacetime around a large, static object like a galaxy?","answerOptions":[{"text":"A modification to the g_tt component of the spacetime metric, caused by the consciousness field (ψ).","isCorrect":true,"rationale":"Correct. The theory posits that ψ alters the g_tt metric component, creating the extra gravitational pull observed in galaxy rotation curves without needing a new dark matter particle."},{"text":"The existence of a new, weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) that only couples to the consciousness field.","isCorrect":false,"rationale":"Incorrect. The theory explicitly aims to explain cosmological observations like this *without* introducing new fundamental particles."},{"text":"A change in the gravitational constant G over galactic distances.","isCorrect":false,"rationale":"Incorrect. While this is a feature of some Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) theories, this theory instead modifies the spacetime metric itself via a new field."},{"text":"The repulsive pressure of dark energy balancing out the gravitational pull at the edges of galaxies.","isCorrect":false,"rationale":"Incorrect. The theory links dark energy to cosmic expansion, not to the localized gravitational effects within a single galaxy."}]},
                {"question":"According to the theory, what is the direct role of consciousness in the process of quantum measurement?","hint":"The theory identifies the 'observer' in the measurement problem with a specific, physically real field.","answerOptions":[{"text":"It is the agent that actively causes the wave-function to collapse.","isCorrect":true,"rationale":"Correct. The theory introduces a collapse operator C_ψ that is directly proportional to the consciousness field, identifying it as the cause of wave-function collapse."},{"text":"It passively selects an outcome from a set of possibilities that have already collapsed.","isCorrect":false,"rationale":"Incorrect. The theory proposes a more active role for consciousness, making it the trigger for the collapse itself, not just a selector of post-collapse outcomes."},{"text":"It protects the quantum system from collapsing by shielding it from environmental decoherence.","isCorrect":false,"rationale":"Incorrect. While the theory does suggest consciousness can slow decoherence, its primary role in measurement is to *cause* the collapse, not prevent it."},{"text":"It has no direct role; quantum collapse is a random process independent of any observer.","isCorrect":false,"rationale":"Incorrect. This is a standard interpretation of quantum mechanics, but the God of the Math theory explicitly rejects it by introducing a consciousness-driven collapse mechanism."}]},
                {"question":"How does the theory explain the emergence of a linear 'arrow of time' from a fundamentally cyclic reality?","hint":"Think about what happens when you combine two sound waves with slightly different pitches.","answerOptions":[{"text":"It is a fundamental property of the universe's master Lagrangian.","isCorrect":false,"rationale":"Incorrect. The theory argues that linear time is not fundamental but is an emergent property resulting from dynamics."},{"text":"It results from the interference 'beat' frequency between the universal blink (ω) and the conscious rhythm (κ).","isCorrect":true,"rationale":"Correct. The superposition of these two slightly different frequencies creates a slower 'beat,' and this emergent, directional rhythm is what we perceive as linear time."},{"text":"It is the statistical average of the underlying cyclic time, which smooths out the oscillations.","isCorrect":false,"rationale":"Incorrect. The infographic states that averaging shows *how* the linear progression is yielded mathematically, but the physical *mechanism* is the beat frequency."},{"text":"It is an illusion created by the continuous, irreversible increase of entropy.","isCorrect":false,"rationale":"Incorrect. The theory proposes that the thermodynamic arrow of time is a *consequence* of the emergent linear time, not its cause. The fundamental dynamics are entropy-free over a full cycle."}]},
                {"question":"What is the proposed function of the brain in this theory?","hint":"The theory suggests the brain doesn't generate consciousness, but rather interacts with a pre-existing field.","answerOptions":[{"text":"It acts as a receiver and modulator (an antenna) for phase-aligned signals, translating them into subjective experience.","isCorrect":true,"rationale":"Correct. The brain is modeled as an interface that resonates with the universal phase field, and this interaction is what generates the qualia of subjective experience."},{"text":"It generates the consciousness field from complex electrochemical processes.","isCorrect":false,"rationale":"Incorrect. The theory posits that the consciousness field is fundamental and universal, not something generated locally by the brain."},{"text":"Its sole purpose is to store memories in a purely material, synaptic format.","isCorrect":false,"rationale":"Incorrect. The theory challenges a purely material model of memory, suggesting that memories can also be stored as imprints in the phase field, independent of the brain."},{"text":"It is a quantum computer that calculates future probabilities.","isCorrect":false,"rationale":"Incorrect. While the brain performs complex computations, its primary role in this theory is to act as an interface for consciousness, not just as a calculator."}]},
                {"question":"What is the theory's most radical prediction regarding the Second Law of Thermodynamics?","hint":"The theory is built on a fundamentally reversible, cyclic foundation. How would this affect entropy over a full cycle?","answerOptions":[{"text":"Over one complete 'blink' cycle, there is no irreversible net increase in entropy.","isCorrect":true,"rationale":"Correct. The theory proposes an 'entropy-free mechanics' where the integral of entropy change over a full cycle is zero, making the Second Law an emergent, statistical effect rather than a fundamental one."},{"text":"Entropy is a conserved quantity and its total amount in the universe never changes.","isCorrect":false,"rationale":"Incorrect. The theory states that entropy oscillates in time; it is not constant. However, its net change over a cycle is zero."},{"text":"The Second Law is fundamentally incorrect and entropy always decreases.","isCorrect":false,"rationale":"Incorrect. The theory doesn't claim the Second Law is wrong, but rather that it's an emergent phenomenon that doesn't apply at the most fundamental, cyclic level of reality."},{"text":"Entropy is created by the consciousness field and is not a thermodynamic property.","isCorrect":false,"rationale":"Incorrect. Entropy is still a thermodynamic property in the theory, but its behavior is governed by the underlying cyclic dynamics of the universal blink."}]},
                {"question":"How is 'qualia' (subjective experience) defined as a physical observable in the theory?","hint":"It must be a scalar quantity formed by combining the consciousness and phase fields.","answerOptions":[{"text":"As a Lorentz-invariant integral combining the intensity of consciousness (|Ψ|²) with the phase field configuration (Φ).","isCorrect":true,"rationale":"Correct. The qualia functional Q = ∫|Ψ|²Φd³x is the simplest Lorentz-invariant scalar that can be constructed from the two fields."},{"text":"As the frequency of neural oscillations in the brain's cortex.","isCorrect":false,"rationale":"Incorrect. While neural oscillations are linked to the *intensity* of qualia, the theory defines qualia itself as a more fundamental field interaction."},{"text":"As a dimensionless constant of nature.","isCorrect":false,"rationale":"Incorrect. Qualia is proposed to be a dynamic, measurable quantity, not a fixed constant."},{"text":"As the rate of entropy production in a conscious system.","isCorrect":false,"rationale":"Incorrect.
