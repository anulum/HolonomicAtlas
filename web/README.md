# anulum.li Website Source (/web/)
---

## 1. Purpose
This directory contains the **complete source code** (HTML, CSS, JS, Markdown, media assets) for the public-facing website `anulum.li`.

This directory *is* the website.

## 2. Synchronization
The `anulum.li` web hosting server is configured as a "mirror" of this directory.

All updates to the public website are made by committing changes to this folder. The live server will then synchronize to this content.

## 3. Protocol
The Gemini-Architect will generate new web assets (e.g., new pages, updated content blocks) for this directory as part of the "Serial Synthesis Protocol (V3.1), Step 7," ensuring the public site is always synchronized with the latest validated research.
