# MASTER SIMULATION & EXPERIMENTAL SUITE
---

## 1. Description
This directory is the single, centralized, and testable code-base for the *Anatomia Holonomica* (Paper 21).

All simulation scripts (`.py`) and their documentation (`.md`) are stored here, named according to their source paper and chapter (e.g., `S_L2_C21_...`).

## 2. Source Monograph
All models and scripts herein are the subject of **Paper 18: The Unified Simulation Architecture**.

The experimental designs derived from these models are detailed in **Paper 17: The Methodological & Experimental Blueprint**.

The falsification criteria for these models are detailed in **Paper 19: The Critical Dialogue & Falsifiability Roadmap**.

## 3. Status
This suite replaces the previous, layer-fragmented simulation folders.
