# MASTER SIMULATION & EXPERIMENTAL SUITE
---

## 1. Description
This directory is the single, centralized, and testable code-base for the *Anatomia Holonomica* (Paper 21).

All simulation scripts (`.py`) and their documentation (`.md`) are stored here, named according to their source paper and chapter (e.g., `S_L2_C21_...`).

## 2. Source Monographs
- **P17: The Methodological & Experimental Blueprint** (The lab protocols)
- **P18: The Unified Simulation Architecture** (The code analysis)
- **P19: The Critical Dialogue & Falsifiability Roadmap** (The null hypotheses)

This suite replaces the previous, layer-fragmented simulation folders.
