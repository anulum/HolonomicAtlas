# Holonomic Atlas Monads

This directory contains the entire 'Anatomia Holonomica' (Paper 21) database.

Each file is a single JSON 'Monad' representing a specific component of the SCPN, from `D0.Microtubule` to `D15.Consilium`.

The database is generated by the Gemini-Architect based on the ground-truth knowledge in the `/Corpus/` and validated by the models in `/Simulations/MASTER_SIMULATION_SUITE/`.
