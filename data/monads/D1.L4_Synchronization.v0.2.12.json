"description": "The emergent classical manifold where the Unified Phase Dynamics Equation (UPDE) governs large-scale coherence. This layer describes how the individual oscillators of L2, guided by the quantum coherence of L1 and the bioelectric fields of L3, phase-lock to form tissue-wide synchronous fields (e.g., EEG rhythms). Its operation is maintained at the 'edge of chaos' via Self-Organized Criticality (SOC), tuned by a fast-slow (L2/L4) control system.",

"name": "Self-Organized Criticality (SOC)",
"description": "The primary operational dynamic. The network tunes itself to the 'edge of chaos' (quasicriticality), a state that optimizes information capacity, sensitivity, and transmission. This is observed as 1/f noise and power-law 'neural avalanches'."

"description": "The homeostatic mechanism that maintains SOC. A fast-timescale (L2, neuronal) adjusts activity locally, while a slow-timescale (L4, glial/metabolic) tunes global parameters to keep the fast system from becoming supercritical (chaotic) or subcritical (frozen)."
