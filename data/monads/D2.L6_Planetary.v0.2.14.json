"description": "This layer describes the coupling of the organism (L5 Self) with large-scale planetary and biospheric fields. It encompasses the organism's entrainment to geophysical rhythms (circadian, seasonal), its participation in collective consciousness fields, and its connection to the Schumann resonances of the Earth's electromagnetic field.",
