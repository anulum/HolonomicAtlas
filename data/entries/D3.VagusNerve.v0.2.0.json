    "Structure": "The tenth cranial nerve (CN X), and the longest and most complex of the cranial nerves. It is the main component of the parasympathetic nervous system (part of the Autonomic Nervous System, D4.ANS).",
    "Function": "Interfaces with parasympathetic control of the heart, lungs, and digestive tract. Transmits a wide range of sensory signals from the viscera to the brain (approx. 80% of its fibers are afferent/sensory).",
    "Pathology": "Gastroparesis, vasovagal syncope, impaired heart rate variability (HRV)."

The D3.Brainstem.NTS and D3.Brain.Insula will show *no L2/L4 fMRI activation*. This would confirm the Vagus is the only conduit for this L2 signal.",
      "H2 (L5 Conduit): A subject with a vagotomy (as in H1) is given a gut-based L5 stimulus (e.g., triggering a 'gut-feeling'). The subject will *fail to report* the L5 'felt-sense' qualia, *even if* they are intellectually aware of the stimulus (e.g., via L2 hormones in the blood). This would falsify the 'Geometric Qualia' (L5) being a non-vagal (e.g., L12 field) signal."
