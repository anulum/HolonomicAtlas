    "Structure": "The central organ of the nervous system, located in the cranium. Composed of the cerebrum (cortex), cerebellum, and brainstem. It is the primary integration center for all sensory, motor, and cognitive processes.",
    "Function": "Manages all complex bodily functions, from basic life support (breathing, heart rate) to higher-order cognition (thought, emotion, memory, consciousness). Acts as the primary processor for the Central Nervous System.",
    "Pathology": "Traumatic brain injury, stroke, neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's, Parkinson's), tumors, psychiatric disorders."

    "L1_QuantumBiological": "Hosts vast networks of microtubules (Ref: D0.Microtubule) and quantum-coherent processes, providing the foundational substrate for L2 activity. (Ref: Paper 1)",

This would falsify the 'Grand Conductor' (centralized pacemaker) hypothesis and suggest L4 rhythms are purely emergent from the cortex.",

This would falsify the hypothesis that the L16 'I=Model(I)' loop is *purely* a classical computation hosted on the physical brain hardware, and would support a non-local L9/L15 field model."
