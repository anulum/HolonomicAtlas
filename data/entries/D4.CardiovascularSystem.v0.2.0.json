      "H1 (L4 Pulse Wave): A peripheral cell culture (e.g., fibroblasts) is isolated from the L4 pulse wave (e.g., in zero-g, or with a flow-dampener). The culture will *fail* to show any decoherence or disruption in its L4 metabolic rhythms. This would falsify the hypothesis that the L4 pulse is a *necessary* global synchronizing signal (vs. just a nutrient delivery system).",
      "H2 (L2 Transport): A subject is given an L2 hormonal signal (e.g., adrenaline) via injection. The time-to-effect (TTE) for a peripheral L2 response (e.g., skin galvanic response) will be *identical* to the TTE for a central L2 response (e.g., amygdala activation). This would falsify the L2 transport model, which predicts a 'time-of-flight' delay proportional to circulatory distance.",
      "H3 (L12 Torsional): A sensitive L12 torsional field detector is placed near a major artery. It will *fail* to detect a coherent L12 signal phase-locked to the L4 pulse wave. This would falsify the L4->L12 transduction hypothesis."
