      "H2 (L4/L5 Binding): A subject is presented with two non-associated stimuli (e.g., a 400Hz tone, a green light) and correctly reports them as two separate L5 qualia. The L4 40Hz Gamma-band synchrony (phase-locking) between the auditory and visual cortices will be *identical* to when the stimuli are 'bound' (e.g., a green, chirping bird). This would falsify the L4 40Hz 'binding-by-synchrony' hypothesis."
