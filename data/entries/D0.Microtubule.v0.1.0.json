    "Structure": "A polymer of tubulin proteins, forming a hollow, cylindrical filament. A key component of the cytoskeleton.",
    "Function": "Provides structural support to cells, forms the mitotic spindle for cell division, and acts as a 'railway' for intracellular transport (via motor proteins like kinesin and dynein).",
    "Pathology": "Disruption is linked to neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., tauopathies like Alzheimer's) and cancer."
