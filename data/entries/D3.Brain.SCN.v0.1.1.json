    "Structure": "The Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN). A tiny, densely packed nucleus within the hypothalamus, situated directly above the optic chiasm.",
    "Function": "The body's 'Master Clock'. It receives direct light information from the D3.Eye.Retina (via ipRGCs) and uses this to entrain the entire organism to the 24-hour day/night cycle. It controls the L4 circadian rhythm.",
    "Pathology": "Circadian rhythm disorders (e.g., advanced/delayed sleep phase), shift work disorder, jet lag."

    "L3_GenomicEpigeneticMorphogenetic": "The 'clock' itself is an L3 'transcriptional-translational feedback loop' (TTFL), where 'clock genes' (e.g., PER, CRY) cyclically repress their own transcription over a ~24-hour period.",
    "L4_CellularTissueSynchronisation": "This *is* the 'L4 Master Oscillator'. Its coherent L3/L4 firing pattern is the central 'pacemaker' that entrains all other peripheral oscillators in the body (e.g., in the liver, lungs). (Ref: Paper 4)",

      "H1 (L8->L3 Entrainment): Exposing an SCN culture to an 'unnatural' 20-hour light/dark cycle (10L/10D) will fail to entrain the L3 (PER/CRY) clock-gene feedback loop to the new 20-hour rhythm. This tests the L8 (light) -> L3 (gene) pathway.",
      "H2 (L1 Magnetoreception): SCN cultures with a genetic knockout of Cryptochrome (CRY) will *still* show circadian entrainment when exposed to a time-varying magnetic field (50uT, 1Hz). This would falsify the hypothesis that CRY is the primary L1 magnetoreceptor."
