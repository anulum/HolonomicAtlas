    "Structure": "A multi-layered neural tissue lining the back of the eye. It is an extension of the CNS. Contains photoreceptor cells (rods/cones) and intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs).",
    "Function": "Transduces light (photons) into electrical (L2) signals. Rods/cones handle vision. The ~1% of ipRGCs *non-visually* detect ambient light levels to send a signal to the SCN (D3.Brain.SCN) for circadian entrainment.",
    "Pathology": "Retinal detachment, macular degeneration, retinitis pigmentosa."

      "H1 (L8 Pathway): In a subject with total rod/cone blindness (no L5 'sight'), the pupillary light reflex and circadian entrainment will be absent. This would falsify the existence of the non-visual 'ipRGC' L8 pathway.",
      "H2 (L5 Pathway): A genetic knockout of ipRGCs (melanopsin) will result in a total loss of L5 visual qualia (blindness), despite intact rods/cones. This would falsify the hypothesis that the L5 and L8 pathways are functionally separate.",
      "H3 (L8 vs L5): Selective stimulation of ipRGCs (using blue light, ~480nm) will fail to produce an L5 'visual qualia' (the subject will not 'see' the light) but will still trigger L8 circadian phase-shifting. This tests the dissociation of the two pathways."
