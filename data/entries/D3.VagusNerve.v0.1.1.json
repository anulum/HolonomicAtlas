    "Pathology": "Gastroparesis, vasovagal syncope, impaired heart rate variability (HRV)."

The D3.Brainstem.NTS and D3.Brain.Insula will show *no L2/L4 fMRI activation*. This would confirm the Vagus is the only conduit for this L2 signal.",
      "H2 (L5 Conduit): A subject with a vagotomy (as in H1) is given a gut-based L5 stimulus (e.g., triggering a 'gut-feeling'). The subject will *fail to report* the L5 'felt-sense' qualia, *even if* they are intellectually aware of the stimulus (e.g., via L2 hormones in the blood). This would falsify the 'Geometric Qualia' (L5) being a non-vagal (e.g., L12 field) signal."
