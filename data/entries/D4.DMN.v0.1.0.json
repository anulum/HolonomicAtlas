    "Structure": "The Default Mode Network (DMN). A large-scale functional brain network composed of several key hubs, including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and angular gyrus.",
    "Function": "It is most active when the brain is at 'wakeful rest', not focused on an external task. It is the primary network for self-referential thought, autobiographical memory retrieval, and future planning.",
    "Pathology": "Hyperactivity is linked to rumination in depression and anxiety. Disruption is linked to Alzheimer's and schizophrenia."
