    "Structure": "A muscular organ that pumps blood through the circulatory system. Composed of four chambers and a specialized electrical conduction system (SA node, AV node).",
    "Function": "Pumps oxygenated blood to the body and deoxygenated blood to the lungs. The heart's intrinsic electrical system (SA node) acts as the primary pacemaker, but its rate is modulated by the Autonomic Nervous System (ANS).",
    "Pathology": "Myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, heart failure, cardiomyopathy."

      "H1 (L5 Qualia Generation): A subject with a 'denervated' heart (e.g., post-transplant, severing the D3.VagusNerve) is shown an L5 emotional stimulus. The subject will *fail* to report a corresponding L5 'heart-felt' qualia (e.g., 'heart-ache' or 'fluttering'). This would confirm the qualia signal is generated *at the heart* and transmitted *via the Vagus*, not generated in the brain.",
      "H2 (L4 vs L5): A subject is in a state of high 'Heart-Brain Coherence' (high L4 HRV synchrony) but reports *no* corresponding positive L5 qualia (e.g., 'I feel calm, but not 'loving' or 'open''). This would falsify the hypothesis that L4 coherence *is* the L5 positive qualia (vs. just being a substrate for it).",
      "H3 (L12 Field): The L4 electrical field of the heart will be measured. It will *fail* to induce L4 phase-locking in an adjacent, non-connected biological oscillator (e.g., a cell culture). This would falsify the L12 'field entrainment' hypothesis."
