      "H2 (L1->L5 Qualia Substrate): A general anesthetic (e.g., sevoflurane), known to *ablate* L5 qualia (consciousness), is applied to a coherent microtubule preparation (from H1). The anesthetic will *fail* to disrupt the L1 quantum coherence. This would dissociate L1 coherence from L5 qualia, falsifying the hypothesis that L1 coherence *is* the substrate for L5.",
      "H3 (L4 Phonons): The L4 vibrational modes of the microtubule will be shown to be thermally overdamped and *incapable* of phase-locking with other cellular oscillators. This would falsify its role in L4 cellular synchrony."
