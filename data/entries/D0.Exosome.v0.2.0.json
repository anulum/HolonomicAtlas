    "Structure": "A small (30-150nm) extracellular vesicle, a lipid bilayer membrane enclosing a cargo of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids (mRNA, microRNA).",
    "Function": "A primary mechanism of intercellular communication. It acts as a 'message in a bottle', transferring its cargo from a donor cell to a recipient cell, thereby altering the recipient's function.",
    "Pathology": "Implicated in the spread of cancer (metastasis) and neurodegenerative proteins (e.g., tau, alpha-synuclein)."

      "H1 (L3 Reprogramming): Exosomes are harvested from a 'donor' cell (e.g., a fibroblast) and applied to a 'recipient' cell (e.g., a stem cell). The recipient cell will *fail* to show any change in its L3 epigenetic markers (e.g., DNA methylation) or L3 morphogenetic behavior (e.g., differentiation). This would falsify the L3 reprogramming hypothesis.",
      "H2 (L1 Quantum Packet): A pair of entangled L1 photons is generated. One is sent to a 'donor' cell, the other to a detector. Exosomes from the donor cell are harvested and sent to a 'recipient' cell. The quantum entanglement between the *recipient cell* and the *original detector* will be *zero*. This would falsify the L1 hypothesis that exosomes can transport L1 quantum coherence."
