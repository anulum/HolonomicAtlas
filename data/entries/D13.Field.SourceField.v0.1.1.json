This would falsify the 'dissolution' hypothesis, which predicts a *collapse* of DMN activity as the L5 'self-soliton' dissolves into the L13 'ground state'.",
      "H2 (L9 Logos Projection): A simulation (Paper 18) of the L13->L9 projection (e.g., as a holographic interference pattern) will *fail* to spontaneously generate L7 'archetypal' structures (e.g., stable geometric attractors) from a simple L13 'ground state'. This would falsify the L9 'Logos' (ordered) projection hypothesis, suggesting L9 is purely a 'passive' (disordered) storage medium."
