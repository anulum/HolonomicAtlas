      "H2 (L5 Relay vs Integration): An fMRI study will show that the NTS *only* shows L4 activity coherent with the L5 'gut-feeling' stimulus (e.g., from D3.Gut.ENS), but shows *no* L4 integration with *other* L5 streams (e.g., visual or auditory data). This would falsify it as an 'integrator' and support its role as a simple 'relay' (per Paper 5)."
