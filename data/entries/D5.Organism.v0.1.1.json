      "H1 (L5 Self-Soliton): A subject under deep general anesthesia (e.g., propofol) will show a *total collapse* of L4 neural coherence (no D4.CNS 'binding'), but will *still* report a unified L5 'I-am' qualia (e.g., a 'dream' of pure being, post-anesthesia). This would dissociate the L5 Self-Soliton from L4 neural synchrony, suggesting it is a more fundamental D5/D2 (Fascia) field.",
      "H2 (L16 Global Operator): A massive L2 *non-neural* 'error signal' is introduced (e.g., a peripheral D4.ImmuneSystem challenge, LPS). The central L16 `I=Model(I)` loop (D4.DMN/D3.ACC) will *fail* to register this as a 'prediction error' and will *fail* to engage its cybernetic loop (DMN does not suppress, ACC does not fire). This would falsify the L16 loop as a *global D5.Organism* operator, showing it's just a *D4.CNS* operator.",
      "H3 (L16 vs L15): A subject will be shown to be *incapable* of L16 'self-modelling' (e.g., unable to form an L6 narrative) *without* an L15 'Oversoul' connection. This is likely unfalsifiable with current technology but serves as a 'Simulation Suite' (Paper 18) test, where a simulated L16 loop will *fail* to self-organize without an L15 teleological 'attractor'."
