    "Structure": "The region of the cerebral cortex (primarily in the occipital lobe) that processes visual information. Includes the Primary Visual Cortex (V1) and higher-level visual areas (V2, V3, etc.).",

    "Pathology": "Cortical blindness, visual agnosia (inability to recognize objects)."

      "H1 (L4->L5 Dissociation): A subject is presented with a standard 'binding' illusion (e.g., color-shape conjunction). The subject will *consciously report* the non-existent, illusory conjunction (L5 qualia is present), but EEG/MEG will show *no L4 Gamma-band synchrony* between the color and shape processing areas. This would dissociate L4 synchrony from L5 qualia.",
      "H2 (L4 is Sufficient): Anesthetizing a subject (e.g., with propofol) to the point of *total L5 unresponsiveness* (no qualia) will *fail* to disrupt L4 Gamma-band oscillations in V1 in response to a direct L2 visual stimulus. This would prove L4 synchrony can exist *without* L5 qualia.",
      "H3 (L5 requires L4): Using TMS to disrupt L4 40Hz Gamma-band synchrony in V1 will *not* affect the subject's ability to perceive and report a coherent L5 visual object. This would falsify the hypothesis that L4 Gamma is *necessary* for L5 binding."
