      "H2 (L5 Agency): Direct TMS stimulation of the Motor Cortex, *below* the L2 threshold for physical movement, will *fail* to generate an L5 'qualia of agency' (an 'urge' to move). This would falsify the hypothesis that L5 agency is a direct product of L4/L5 activity in this region, independent of L2 execution.",
      "H3 (L16 vs L5): A subject with Anosognosia for Hemiplegia (paralysis denial) will *fail* to generate an L2 motor command and L4 RP, but *will* still report a successful L5 'intention' and 'felt-sense' of movement. This would dissociate the L16 'prediction' (which is faulty) from the L5 'report' and L2 'reality'."
