This would falsify the L16 model, which states that L6 'planning' (DLPFC) is the act of *retrieving and re-combining* L9 'memories' (via DMN).",
      "H3 (L16 Executive): A subject is told to *inhibit* a prepotent motor action. This L16 'inhibition' command will *fail* to produce a measurable L4 Beta-band 'braking' signal in the DLPFC/Motor Cortex. This would falsify the role of the DLPFC as the L16 'Executive Controller'."
