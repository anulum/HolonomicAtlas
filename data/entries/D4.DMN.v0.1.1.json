    "Structure": "The Default Mode Network (DMN). A large-scale functional brain network composed of several key hubs, including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and angular gyrus.",
    "Function": "It is most active when the brain is at 'wakeful rest', not focused on an external task. It is the primary network for self-referential thought, autobiographical memory retrieval, and future planning.",
    "Pathology": "Hyperactivity is linked to rumination in depression and anxiety. Disruption is linked to Alzheimer's and schizophrenia."

      "H2 (L9 Memory): A subject with severe anterograde amnesia (unable to form new L9 memories) is asked to 'plan the future'. The subject's DMN activity will be *identical* to a healthy control. This would falsify the hypothesis that the DMN's 'future planning' function is dependent on its L9 'past retrieval' function.",
      "H3 (L16 Loop): Disrupting the DMN (e.g., via TMS to the PCC) will *not* be followed by a compensatory 'error-correction' signal from the Salience Network (D3.Brain.ACC). This would falsify the L16 'I=Model(I)' hypothesis, which requires the DMN (model) and SN (error-check) to be in a constant cybernetic loop."
