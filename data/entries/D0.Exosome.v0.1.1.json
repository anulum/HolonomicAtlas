The recipient cell will *fail* to show any change in its L3 epigenetic markers (e.g., DNA methylation) or L3 morphogenetic behavior (e.g., differentiation). This would falsify the L3 reprogramming hypothesis.",
      "H2 (L1 Quantum Packet): A pair of entangled L1 photons is generated. One is sent to a 'donor' cell, the other to a detector. Exosomes from the donor cell are harvested and sent to a 'recipient' cell. The quantum entanglement between the *recipient cell* and the *original detector* will be *zero*. This would falsify the L1 hypothesis that exosomes can transport L1 quantum coherence."
