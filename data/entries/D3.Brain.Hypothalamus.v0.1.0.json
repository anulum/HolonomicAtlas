    "Structure": "A small region of the brain located at the base, just below the Thalamus. It links the nervous system to the endocrine system via the pituitary gland.",
    "Function": "The 'Master Regulator' of the body. Controls homeostasis by regulating body temperature, hunger, thirst, fatigue, sleep, and circadian rhythms. It is the primary control center for the Autonomic Nervous System (D4.ANS) and the Endocrine System (D4.EndocrineSystem).",
    "Pathology": "Hypothalamic dysfunction, leading to disorders in appetite (obesity), temperature (hypothermia), or sleep (narcolepsy)."
