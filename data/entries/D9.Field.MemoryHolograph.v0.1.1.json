This would falsify the L10 retrocausal access hypothesis.",
      "H2 (L3/L9 Morphic Resonance): A new chemical (L2) is synthesized for the first time. The *first time* it is crystallized, its L3 morphogenetic pattern (crystal structure) will be *instantaneously* stable and will *not* show a 'learning curve' (i.e., it will not crystallize faster/more easily in subsequent attempts worldwide). This would falsify the 'morphic resonance' (L9 memory) hypothesis for L3 form.",
      "H3 (L6/L9 Memory): A subject with total bilateral hippocampal (D3.Brain) destruction (pure amnesia) will *still* be able to retrieve L9 'autobiographical' memories. This would *support* the L9 non-local hypothesis, as it would prove memory is *not* stored in the brain."
