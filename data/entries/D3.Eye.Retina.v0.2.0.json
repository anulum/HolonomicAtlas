"Structure": "The light-sensitive layer of tissue at the back of the inner eye. Contains photoreceptor cells (rods and cones).",
"Function": "Detects light and converts it into neural signals. Performs initial visual processing (e.g., edge detection, motion detection).",
"Pathology": "Retinal detachment, macular degeneration, retinitis pigmentosa."

"L1_QuantumBiological": "The site of primary quantum transduction. Photoreceptor cells (rods/cones) use quantum effects (e.g., photoisomerization of rhodopsin) to convert a single photon into a macroscopic neural signal.",

"L4_CellularTissueSynchronisation": "Formalizes tissue-level dynamics via phase-coupled oscillators, quasicritical operation (Griffiths regimes), and multi-path coupling (gap junctions, ephaptic fields, glial/vascular slow control). Models entrainment to cosmological rhythms (Schumann, lunar) via biophotons and cryptochromes.",
