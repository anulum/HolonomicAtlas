    "Structure": "A polymer of tubulin proteins, forming a hollow, cylindrical filament. A key component of the cytoskeleton.",
    "Function": "Provides structural support to cells, forms the mitotic spindle for cell division, and acts as a 'railway' for intracellular transport (via motor proteins like kinesin and dynein).",
    "Pathology": "Disruption is linked to neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., tauopathies like Alzheimer's) and cancer."

      "H1 (L1 Fröhlich Coherence): A living microtubule, when metabolically 'pumped' by ATP (L1 battery), will *fail* to exhibit the predicted coherent L1 phonon emissions (e.g., in the THz range) via Raman spectroscopy. This would falsify the Fröhlich condensation hypothesis.",
      "H2 (L1->L5 Qualia Substrate): A general anesthetic (e.g., sevoflurane), known to *ablate* L5 qualia (consciousness), is applied to a coherent microtubule preparation (from H1). The anesthetic will *fail* to disrupt the L1 quantum coherence. This would dissociate L1 coherence from L5 qualia, falsifying the hypothesis that L1 coherence *is* the substrate for L5.",
      "H3 (L4 Phonons): The L4 vibrational modes of the microtubule will be shown to be thermally overdamped and *incapable* of phase-locking with other cellular oscillators. This would falsify its role in L4 cellular synchrony."
