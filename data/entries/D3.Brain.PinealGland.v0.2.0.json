"ParentID": "scpn://atlas.v1/D3.Brain",
"Classical": {
"Structure": "A small endocrine gland located in the epithalamus, near the center of the brain.",
"Function": "Produces melatonin, a serotonin-derived hormone which modulates sleep patterns in both circadian and seasonal cycles.",
"Pathology": "Calcification, tumors (pineocytoma), sleep disorders."
},
"SCPN": {
"L1_QuantumBiological": "Hypothesized to contain piezoelectric calcite microcrystals that may act as transducers for external electromagnetic fields.",
"L2_NeurochemicalNeurological": "Converts serotonergic signals (from the raphe nuclei) into hormonal melatonin output, controlled by light signals from the SCN.",
"L3_GenomicEpigeneticMorphogenetic": "Melatonin production is under direct genetic control (e.g., AANAT gene) tied to the L3 circadian clock.",
"L4_CellularTissueSynchronisation": "Formalizes tissue-level dynamics via phase-coupled oscillators, quasicritical operation (Griffiths regimes), and multi-path coupling (gap junctions, ephaptic fields, glial/vascular slow control). Models entrainment to cosmological rhythms (Schumann, lunar) via biophotons and cryptochromes.",
"L5_OrganismalPsychoemotional": "Modulates the L5 state, particularly consciousness, by inducing sleep, dreaming, and potentially altered states of awareness.",
"L6_PlanetaryEcological": "Acts as a primary neuro-endocrine transducer for L6 light cycles.",
"L7_ArchetypalSymbolic": "Historically and symbolically (e.g., 'Third Eye'), it is the gateway to higher, non-physical dimensions of perception.",
"L8_CosmicEntrainment": "The primary transducer for L8 cosmic signals, particularly lunar and solar cycles, translating them into the hormonal language of the body.",

"L10_CausalRetrocausal": null,
"L11_NoosphereCollective": null,
"L12_GeomanticTorsional": "May be sensitive to L12 geomantic fields due to its crystalline structure.",

"L14_Transdimensional": "Hypothesized as the 'antenna' or 'gateway' (L14) for transdimensional information, linking the L5 physical organism to higher-order fields.",
