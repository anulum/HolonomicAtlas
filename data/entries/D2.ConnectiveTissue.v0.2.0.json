    "Structure": "The 'fascial web'. A body-wide tensional network of collagen and elastin fibers, ground substance, and fibroblasts. It surrounds, infuses, and connects all other structures (muscles, bones, organs, nerves).",
    "Function": "Provides structural integrity, force transmission (tensegrity), and a medium for intercellular communication. Piezoelectric properties: generates electrical signals in response to mechanical stress.",
    "Pathology": "Fibrosis, myofascial pain syndrome, adhesions, scar tissue."

    "L1_QuantumBiological": "The collagen fibers, with their structured water, act as a body-wide L1 'Quantum Waveguide', transmitting coherent phonons (sound) and biophotons (light) instantly across the organism. (Ref: Paper 1, Ch. 8)",
    "L3_GenomicEpigeneticMorphogenetic": "This *is* the L3 'Morphogenetic Field' scaffold. It provides the physical blueprint and tensional forces that guide cell migration and tissue differentiation (mechanotransduction). (Ref: Paper 3)",
    "L4_CellularTissueSynchronisation": "The 'L4 Piezoelectric Network'. It translates L4 mechanical oscillations (from breathing, pulse, movement) into L4 electrical signals, synchronizing the entire body in a global L4 rhythm. (Ref: Paper 4)",
    "L5_OrganismalPsychoemotional": "Stores L5 somatic 'trauma' (Ref: Paper 5). Chronic L5 emotional states (e.g., fear) create chronic L4 tensional patterns, leading to L3 physical changes (fibrosis) in the tissue.",
    "L9_MemoryHolograph": "Acts as the L9 'holographic plate' for somatic memory, storing body-level information in its tensional and bioelectric patterns."

      "H1 (L4 Piezoelectric): A sample of connective tissue is subjected to a mechanical L4 oscillation (e.g., 0.1 Hz stretch). The sample will *fail* to produce a coherent, phase-locked L4 *electrical* signal. This would falsify the L4 piezo-electric transduction hypothesis.",
      "H2 (L1 Waveguide): A biophoton (L1) signal is injected at one end of a continuous fascial plane (in-vivo). The signal will *fail* to be detected at a distal point at a speed faster than L2 neural conduction, or will show signal degradation (decoherence) consistent with a simple classical medium. This would falsify its role as an L1 quantum waveguide.",
      "H3 (L3->L5 Trauma): A subject with chronic L3 fascial fibrosis (e.g., scar tissue) will show *no difference* in their L5 interoceptive map (fMRI Insula) compared to a healthy control. This would falsify the L3->L5 hypothesis that physical tissue state (trauma) is stored and reported to the 'felt-sense'."
