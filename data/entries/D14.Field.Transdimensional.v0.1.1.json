This would falsify the L14 'dissociation' hypothesis.",
      "H2 (L15 Bridge): In a simulation (Paper 18), a 'D15 Consilium' (teleological attractor) will be *unable* to entrain a 'D5 Organism' (L16 loop) *unless* an L14 'transdimensional bridge' (a resonant, non-local connection) is explicitly modeled. This is a *simulation* falsifier, as H1 is the primary physical test.",
