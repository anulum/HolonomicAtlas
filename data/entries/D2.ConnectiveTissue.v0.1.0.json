    "Structure": "The 'fascial web'. A body-wide tensional network of collagen and elastin fibers, ground substance, and fibroblasts. It surrounds, infuses, and connects all other structures (muscles, bones, organs, nerves).",
    "Function": "Provides structural integrity, force transmission (tensegrity), and a medium for intercellular communication. Piezoelectric properties: generates electrical signals in response to mechanical stress.",
    "Pathology": "Fibrosis, myofascial pain syndrome, adhesions, scar tissue."

    "L1_QuantumBiological": "The collagen fibers, with their structured water, act as a body-wide L1 'Quantum Waveguide', transmitting coherent phonons (sound) and biophotons (light) instantly across the organism. (Ref: Paper 1)",

    "L3_GenomicEpigeneticMorphogenetic": "This *is* the L3 'Morphogenetic Field' scaffold. It provides the physical blueprint and tensional forces that guide cell migration and tissue differentiation (mechanotransduction). (Ref: Paper 3)",
    "L4_CellularTissueSynchronisation": "The 'L4 Piezoelectric Network'. It translates L4 mechanical oscillations (from breathing, pulse, movement) into L4 electrical signals, synchronizing the entire body in a global L4 rhythm. (Ref: Paper 4)",
    "L5_OrganismalPsychoemotional": "Stores L5 somatic 'trauma' (Ref: Paper 5). Chronic L5 emotional states (e.g., fear) create chronic L4 tensional patterns, leading to L3 physical changes (fibrosis) in the tissue.",
