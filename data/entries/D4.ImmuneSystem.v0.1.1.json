    "Structure": "A complex network of cells (e.g., lymphocytes, macrophages), tissues (lymph nodes, spleen, thymus), and organs that work together to defend the body against pathogens.",
    "Function": "Identifies and neutralizes 'non-self' entities (viruses, bacteria, parasites). Also performs surveillance and removes damaged or aberrant 'self' cells (e.g., cancer).",
    "Pathology": "Autoimmune disease (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis), immunodeficiency (e.g., AIDS), allergies, chronic inflammation."

This will *fail* to correlate with a corresponding 'prediction error' signal in the *central* L16 cybernetic loop (e.g., no matching DMN/ACC activity). This would falsify the hypothesis that the cellular L16 and central L16 loops are coupled.",
      "H3 (L9 Memory): A 'memory' T-cell will be shown to be *incapable* of holding its L9 'pathogen-memory' *without* periodic L4/L2 'refresh' signals from its environment. This would falsify the L9 'static memory' (holographic) hypothesis in favor of a purely dynamic (L4) memory."
