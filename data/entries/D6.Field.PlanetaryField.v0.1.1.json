The subject's L4 Alpha-band (8-12Hz) brain rhythms will show *no decoherence, drift, or loss of power*. This would falsify the L4 (Schumann) -> L4 (Alpha) entrainment hypothesis.",
      "H2 (L8 Light Entrainment): A D5.Organism is placed in a 'free-run' bunker (no L8 light cues), but the L4 Schumann and L12 Geomagnetic fields are left intact. The organism's L4 circadian rhythm (e.g., L2 melatonin) will *fail* to entrain to the 24-hour planetary cycle. This would confirm that the L8 'light' signal (via D3.Eye.Retina) is the *only* planetary entrainment pathway, and that L4/L12 fields are *not*."
