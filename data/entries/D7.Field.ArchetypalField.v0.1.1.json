      "H1 (L7 Symbolic Operator): A subject is presented with a potent L7 'archetypal' symbol (e.g., Ouroboros) vs. a 'novel' but equally complex geometric symbol. The L7 symbol will *fail* to produce a stronger or qualitatively different L5/L4 'numinous' response (e.g., in the D3.Brain.Insula/D3.Heart) than the novel symbol. This would falsify the L7 field as an active 'operator' on L5 qualia.",
      "H2 (L6 Narrative Template): A subject's L6 narrative (D4.DMN) is recorded during a 'life-story' task. The narrative structure will show *no correlation* with the L7 archetypal 'Hero's Journey' template (e.g., will lack key stages like 'Call to Adventure', 'Refusal', 'Resurrection'). This would falsify the L7 field as a 'narrative template' for the L6 DMN."
