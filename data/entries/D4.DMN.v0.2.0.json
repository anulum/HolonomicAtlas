"Structure": "Default Mode Network. A large-scale brain network of interacting regions (including medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and angular gyrus).",
"Function": "Active when the brain is at 'wakeful rest' (not focused on an external task). Involved in self-referential thought, mind-wandering, and autobiographical memory.",
"Pathology": "Hyperactivity in depression (rumination), hypoactivity in Alzheimer's (loss of self)."
