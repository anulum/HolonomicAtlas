    "Structure": "A double-membraned organelle, the 'powerhouse of the cell'. Contains its own DNA (mtDNA).",
    "Function": "Generates most of the cell's supply of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), used as a source of chemical energy. Also involved in signaling, cell death (apoptosis), and heat production.",
    "Pathology": "Mitochondrial disease, oxidative stress, role in aging and neurodegeneration."

    "L1_QuantumBiological": "The 'L1 Battery'. Provides the metabolic energy (ATP) required to create and sustain L1 coherence (e.g., Fröhlich pumping in D0.Microtubules). (Ref: Paper 1)",
    "L2_NeurochemicalNeurological": "The 'L2 Power Regulator'. ATP is itself an L2 neurotransmitter. Mitochondria also buffer L2 calcium signals, shaping synaptic transmission. (Ref: Paper 2)",
    "L3_GenomicEpigeneticMorphogenetic": "Mitochondrial health (e.g., ROS signals) is a key L3 signal for apoptosis (programmed cell death), a core morphogenetic process.",
    "L4_CellularTissueSynchronisation": "Mitochondria form dynamic, fused networks ('syncytia') that oscillate, synchronizing the L4 metabolic state of the entire cell and linking it to L4 neural firing.",
    "L5_OrganismalPsychoemotional": "The overall L5 'energy level' (e.t., vigor, fatigue) is a direct mapping of the organism's total mitochondrial (L1/L2) efficiency.",
