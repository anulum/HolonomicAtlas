    "Structure": "The Peripheral Nervous System (PNS). Consists of all nerves and ganglia outside the Central Nervous System (D4.CNS). It is divided into the Somatic (voluntary) and Autonomic (involuntary, D4.ANS) systems.",
    "Function": "Connects the CNS to the limbs, organs, and skin. Transmits sensory information (somatic/interoceptive) to the CNS and motor commands from the CNS.",
    "Pathology": "Peripheral neuropathy, carpal tunnel syndrome, Guillain-Barré syndrome."

This would falsify the PNS as the *only* conduit for this L5 signal, suggesting a direct D2.ConnectiveTissue or L12 field-based pathway.",
      "H2 (L9 Somatic Memory): A 'de-afferented' subject (PNS sensory input is severed, but motor output is intact) will be *unable* to perform a *learned* L9 procedural motor task (e.g., signing their name). This would falsify the L9 'somatic memory' (CPG) hypothesis, suggesting L9 motor memory is *not* stored in the PNS but is a *real-time loop* requiring L5 sensory feedback."
