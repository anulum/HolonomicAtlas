    "Structure": "The Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN). A tiny, densely packed nucleus within the hypothalamus, situated directly above the optic chiasm.",
    "Function": "The body's 'Master Clock'. It receives direct light information from the D3.Eye.Retina (via ipRGCs) and uses this to entrain the entire organism to the 24-hour day/night cycle. It controls the L4 circadian rhythm.",
    "Pathology": "Circadian rhythm disorders (e.g., advanced/delayed sleep phase), shift work disorder, jet lag."

    "L1_QuantumBiological": "Cryptochromes in the SCN (and Retina) are hypothesized L1 magnetoreceptors, allowing L8/L12 geomagnetic information to entrain the clock.",
    "L2_NeurochemicalNeurological": "Receives an L2 (glutamate) signal from the Retina. Sends an L2 (GABA, VIP) signal to the D3.Brain.PinealGland (via a multi-synaptic pathway) to control melatonin release.",
    "L3_GenomicEpigeneticMorphogenetic": "The 'clock' itself is an L3 'transcriptional-translational feedback loop' (TTFL), where 'clock genes' (e.g., PER, CRY) cyclically repress their own transcription over a ~24-hour period.",
    "L4_CellularTissueSynchronisation": "This *is* the 'L4 Master Oscillator'. Its coherent L3/L4 firing pattern is the central 'pacemaker' that entrains all other peripheral oscillators in the body (e.g., in the liver, lungs). (Ref: Paper 4)",
    "L5_OrganismalPsychoemotional": "Drives the L5 qualia of 'wakefulness' and 'sleepiness'.",
