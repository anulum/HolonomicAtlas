    "Structure": "The region of the cerebral cortex (primarily in the occipital lobe) that processes visual information. Includes the Primary Visual Cortex (V1) and higher-level visual areas (V2, V3, etc.).",
    "Function": "Receives the L2 visual data stream from the D3.Brain.Thalamus (LGN). V1 detects basic features (edges, orientation, color). Higher areas (V2+) assemble these features into complex shapes and objects.",
    "Pathology": "Cortical blindness, visual agnosia (inability to recognize objects)."
