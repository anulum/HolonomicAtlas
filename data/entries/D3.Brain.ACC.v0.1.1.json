      "H2 (L5 Qualia): A subject with a total ACC lesion will be *unable* to perform error-correction on a task (L16 function is broken), but will still *verbally report* the L5 'felt-sense' of 'wrongness' or 'dissonance'. This would dissociate the L16 computation from the L5 qualia generation.",
      "H3 (DMN-ACC Loop): In a healthy subject, high L4 coherence (activity) in the D4.DMN (L6 'self-narrative') will *not* be immediately followed by a corresponding suppression and L4 spike in the ACC (L16 'error check') when presented with a 'self-conflicting' stimulus. This would falsify the 'cybernetic loop' model of the Triple Network."
