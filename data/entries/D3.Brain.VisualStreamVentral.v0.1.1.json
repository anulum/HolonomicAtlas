The subject will be able to *use* the cup correctly (intact L5 'what-it-is-for' qualia), but will fail to generate the L6 'noun' ('cup'). This would dissociate L5 recognition (Ventral) from L6 naming (DMN/Language).",
      "H2 (Visual Agnosia): A subject with visual agnosia will show normal L2/L4 activity in V1 (seeing features) but no coherent L4/L5 activation in the Ventral Stream (no 'recognition'). This would falsify the hypothesis that V1 is sufficient for L5 recognition.",
      "H3 (L7 Symbolism): A subject is shown a novel L7 symbol. The Ventral Stream (L5) will show high activity (pattern recognition), but the L6 DMN/language centers will show *low* activity (no associated 'noun' or narrative). This tests the L5 'recognition' vs. L6 'naming' split."
