This would falsify the hypothesis that the CNS *as a whole* (including sub-cortical structures) is the L5 integrator, suggesting L5 is a *purely cortical* phenomenon that can be split.",

This would *support* the hypothesis that the L16 operator *is* the entire CNS, and that the cybernetic loop breaks without L5/L2 interoceptive input from the body."
