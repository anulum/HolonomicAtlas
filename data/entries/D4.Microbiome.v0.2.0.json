    "Pathology": "Dysbiosis (imbalance), linked to IBD, obesity, depression, and anxiety."

      "H2 (L2 Vagal Pathway): A 'germ-free' animal (from H1) is given a 'fecal-microbiota transplant' (FMT) from an 'anxious' donor. The recipient animal *will* develop the anxious L5 phenotype, *even after* a complete vagotomy (D3.VagusNerve lesion). This would falsify the L5 signal as being *primarily* vagal (H2a) and support a *purely* L2 circulatory/hormonal pathway (H2b).",
