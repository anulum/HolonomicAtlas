    "Structure": "The Autonomic Nervous System (ANS), a division of the peripheral nervous system (PNS). It consists of the Sympathetic (fight-or-flight) and Parasympathetic (rest-and-digest) branches.",
    "Function": "Controls involuntary bodily functions, including heart rate, digestion, respiratory rate, and pupillary response. Manages the body's homeostatic balance.",
