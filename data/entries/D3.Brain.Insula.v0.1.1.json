    "Function": "The primary 'interoceptive' cortex. It integrates all sensory data from the body's internal state (e.g., from NTS, Vagus) to create the 'felt-sense' of being. Linked to emotion, self-awareness, and empathy.",
    "Pathology": "Disruption linked to anxiety, addiction, and psychosomatic disorders. Key in 'alexithymia' (inability to feel/identify emotions)."

      "H1 (L5 Integration): A subject is given an L2 beta-blocker (blocking the D3.Heart's L2 signal) but is shown a 'fear' stimulus. The subject will report a *full* L5 'qualia of fear' (e.g., 'I feel afraid') despite the Insula showing *no* L2/L4 'heart-racing' input. This would falsify the hypothesis that the Insula *integrates* peripheral body signals to *create* the L5 qualia.",
      "H2 (L5 vs L6): A subject with Alexithymia (difficulty *naming* L6 feelings) will show *no L4/L5 activation* in the Insula in response to a visceral L2 stimulus (e.g., a painful shock). This would falsify the hypothesis that L5 'feeling' (Insula) and L6 'naming' (DMN/Language) are dissociable.",
      "H3 (vs ACC): The Insula will show high L4/L5 activity *not just* during raw interoception (e.g., 'I feel my heart'), but also during high-level 'prediction error' tasks (e.g., a Stroop test). This would falsify the SCPN 'division of labor' where the Insula (L5 data) and ACC (L16 error) are separate modules in the Salience Network."
