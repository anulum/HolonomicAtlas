"Classical": {
"Structure": "Suprachiasmatic Nucleus. A tiny region in the hypothalamus, located directly above the optic chiasm.",
"Function": "The central 'master clock' of the human body. Receives light signals directly from the retina (retinohypothalamic tract) and entrains the entire organism to the 24-hour light-dark cycle.",
"Pathology": "Circadian rhythm sleep disorders, delayed sleep phase syndrome."

"L1_QuantumBiological": null,
"L2_NeurochemicalNeurological": "Acts as the central pacemaker, sending periodic signals to the pineal gland (to control melatonin) and other peripheral oscillators.",
"L3_GenomicEpigeneticMorphogenetic": "Contains the core genetic feedback loops (e.g., CLOCK/BMAL1) that constitute the ~24-hour molecular oscillator.",
"L4_CellularTissueSynchronisation": "Formalizes tissue-level dynamics via phase-coupled oscillators, quasicritical operation (Griffiths regimes), and multi-path coupling (gap junctions, ephaptic fields, glial/vascular slow control). Models entrainment to cosmological rhythms (Schumann, lunar) via biophotons and cryptochromes.",
"L5_OrganismalPsychoemotional": "Provides the foundational 'beat' or 'tempo' for the L5 conscious state (e.g., wakefulness, sleepiness).",
