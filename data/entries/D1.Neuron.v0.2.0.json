      "H1 (L1->L2 Firing): A neuron's L2 action potential (firing) will be shown to be *fully* described by the classical Hodgkin-Huxley model (ion channels). The timing of its firing will show *no* quantum-statistical deviation (e.g., non-Poissonian statistics) that would imply an L1 quantum-reduction trigger (from D0.Microtubule).",
      "H2 (L1->L5 Anesthesia): A general anesthetic (which ablates L5 qualia) will be applied to a single neuron. It will *fail* to disrupt the L1 coherence of its internal D0.Microtubules (see D0.Microtubule.Validation.H2). This would dissociate neuronal L1 coherence from L5 consciousness.",
      "H3 (L4 Oscillator): A single, isolated neuron (in-vitro) will *fail* to produce a stable, endogenous L4 oscillation (rhythm). This would falsify its role as a fundamental 'oscillator' and suggest L4 rhythms are *purely* an emergent property of the *network*."
