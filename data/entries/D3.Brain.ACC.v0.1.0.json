    "Structure": "The Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC), a hub in the limbic system. Key node in the 'Salience Network' (SN), along with the Insula.",
    "Function": "Error detection, conflict monitoring, emotional regulation, and reward-based decision making. It assesses the 'salience' (importance) of incoming stimuli and signals when a prediction error has occurred.",
    "Pathology": "Hyperactivity linked to anxiety, OCD, and chronic pain. Underactivity linked to apathy and depression."
