    "Structure": "The tenth cranial nerve (CN X), and the longest and most complex of the cranial nerves. It is the main component of the parasympathetic nervous system (part of the Autonomic Nervous System, D4.ANS).",

    "Pathology": "Gastroparesis, vasovagal syncope, impaired heart rate variability (HRV)."
