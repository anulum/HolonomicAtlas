    "Structure": "A long, thin, tubular structure of nervous tissue, which extends from the medulla oblongata in the brainstem to the lumbar region. It comprises the 'information highway' of the CNS.",
    "Function": "Transmits neural signals between the brain and the rest of the body. Also contains independent neural circuits known as Central Pattern Generators (CPGs) that control reflexes and rhythmic motor patterns (e.g., walking).",
    "Pathology": "Spinal cord injury (SCI), myelopathy, syringomyelia."
