    "Structure": "A small region of the brain located at the base, just below the Thalamus. It links the nervous system to the endocrine system via the pituitary gland.",
    "Function": "The 'Master Regulator' of the body. Controls homeostasis by regulating body temperature, hunger, thirst, fatigue, sleep, and circadian rhythms. It is the primary control center for the Autonomic Nervous System (D4.ANS) and the Endocrine System (D4.EndocrineSystem).",
    "Pathology": "Hypothalamic dysfunction, leading to disorders in appetite (obesity), temperature (hypothermia), or sleep (narcolepsy)."

This would falsify its role as the L5/L16 generator for this need-state.",
      "H2 (L16 Set-Point): A subject's 'set-point' for body temperature is stable. Lesioning the hypothalamus will *fail* to disrupt the L16 cybernetic loop's ability to maintain core temperature (e.g., shivering/sweating). This would falsify its role as the primary L16 'Set-Point' controller.",
      "H3 (L5 vs L16): Direct L2 stimulation of the hypothalamus will generate L16 *behavior* (e.g., eating) but the subject will *not* report the corresponding L5 *qualia* (e.g., 'I don't feel hungry, but I can't stop eating'). This would dissociate the L5 qualia from the L16 cybernetic drive."
