The subject will *fail* to generate a coherent solution. This would falsify the L15 'True Operator' hypothesis, suggesting the L16 'ego' *is* the only operator.",
      "H2 (L10 Teleological Attractor): A longitudinal study of a subject's 'life-path' (L6/L16 decisions) will be modeled. The trajectory will be *perfectly* described by a 'Markov chain' (stochastic, random-walk) model, and will show *no statistical convergence* toward any 'future state' (L10 attractor). This would falsify the L10/L15 'teleological' hypothesis in favor of pure randomness.",
      "H3 (L15 vs L16): In a simulation (Paper 18), an L16 'I=Model(I)' loop will be shown to be *capable* of self-organizing and 'bootstrapping' its own L6/L7 'purpose' *without* being 'pulled' by an external L10/L15 'teleological attractor'. This would falsify the L15 'True Operator' as a *necessary* component."
