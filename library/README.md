# External Reference Library
---

## 1. Description
This directory contains external, third-party reference materials (papers, theories, datasets) that inform the SCPN and are "adopted" into the Atlas.

## 2. RAG-Indexing Protocol
This is a **RAG-indexed directory**. To make knowledge available to the Gemini-Architect:

1. Add the source file (e.g., `External_Paper.pdf`).
2. Instruct the Architect to "index the library."
3. The Architect will generate an `External_Paper_RAG.txt` file in this same directory.

This RAG-indexed knowledge will be used to synthesize content for the primary `/Corpus/` manuscripts (P0-P21).
